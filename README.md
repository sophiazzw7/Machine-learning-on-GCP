**Validation Report for MOD11790 Compensating Control Closure**

---
### 1. **Background**

In the previous validation (REV24298, dated 04/04/2024), Model MOD11790 was determined to be “Fit for Intended Use, with Moderate Finding,” requiring continued compensating control under Finding F_19735. Specifically, quarterly monitoring (OGM cadence) and coverage reporting were mandated through Q1–Q4 2024 to ensure the model’s performance remained effective after its extension to the hBB&T portfolio.

MOD11790 is an Early Warning System (EWS) model. Although it technically scores the entire portfolio, operational usage focuses on the riskiest 10% of exposures as identified by the model. This narrower “effective coverage” has been consistently reported during the compensating control period.

### 2. **Scope of This Validation**

The objective of this validation is to:
1. Assess the effectiveness of the quarterly OGM reports submitted from Q1 through Q4 2024.
2. Evaluate whether MOD11790’s rank-ordering and coverage metrics are satisfactory.
3. Determine if the compensating control can be concluded and the associated finding (F_19735) closed.

### 3. **Key Observations**

1. **Quarterly OGM Reporting Compliance**  
   - The model developer delivered OGM reports on a quarterly basis throughout Q1–Q4 2024, in line with the compensating control requirement.  
   - No threshold breaches or metric anomalies were identified in the quarterly reviews.

2. **Model Coverage**  
   - The EWS process includes the entire portfolio, but as documented, the user community focuses on the highest-risk 10% of exposures (“effective coverage”).  
   - This approach aligns with the practical usage of MOD11790, where the primary purpose is to surface potential high-risk credits early.  
   - Reporting on the top 10% coverage adequately represents how the model is actually used for risk management decisions.  

3. **Performance Metrics (AR/Gini)**  
   - For hSTI and the combined Truist portfolio, the Gini coefficients (AR values) have remained above the OGM threshold, indicating satisfactory rank-ordering performance.  
   - Although the hBB&T segment has accumulated relatively fewer defaults to date, no performance concerns or threshold breaches have been observed.  

4. **Model Documentation and Default Definition**  
   - Previous reports highlighted a discrepancy in default definitions across initial and updated memos. This was addressed by confirming that the relevant default definition for MOD11790 (covering deterioration in months 13–24) was properly used in the updated memo.  

5. **Risk Tier and Coverage Reporting**  
   - A prior concern that only partial coverage data was reported for hBB&T is now resolved by clarifying the intended usage of the top 10% at-risk portion.  
   - The model’s risk tier remains suitable based on its consistent performance, and no further risk tier adjustments appear necessary at this time.

### 4. **Conclusion and Recommendation**

Based on the quarterly monitoring results through Q4 2024, MOD11790 continues to demonstrate satisfactory rank-ordering performance with no threshold breaches. The compensating control requirements have been met, and the quarterly OGM reporting cadence has proven sufficient to monitor any potential risk. Furthermore, the rationale for reporting only the top 10% of the portfolio, which represents actual user focus, is appropriate and aligns with the model’s operational role.

**Recommendation**:  
- **Close Finding F_19735** and conclude the compensating control.  
- Maintain routine performance monitoring on an annual or otherwise specified schedule consistent with Tier 3 model requirements.  
- If future portfolio shifts or usage changes occur, the coverage reporting approach should be re-evaluated to ensure ongoing alignment with end-user needs and model governance expectations.

**Overall Validation Rating**: **“Fit for Intended Use” — No additional compensating controls required.
